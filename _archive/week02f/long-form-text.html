  <h1>Cognitive illusions</h1>
  <img src="https://picsum.photos/300/300" alt="Random Lorem Picsum Image">
  <p>Cognitive illusions are assumed to arise by interaction with assumptions about the world, leading to "unconscious inferences", an idea first suggested in the 19th century by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany">German</a> physicist and physician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_von_Helmholtz">Hermann Helmholtz</a> .[16] Cognitive illusions are commonly divided into ambiguous illusions, distorting illusions, paradox illusions, or fiction illusions.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Ambiguous illusions are pictures or objects that elicit a perceptual "switch" between the alternative interpretations. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necker_cube">Necker cube</a> is a well-known example; other instances are the Rubin vase and the "squircle", based on Kokichi Sugihara's ambiguous cylinder illusion.[17]</li>
    <li> Distorting or geometrical-optical illusions are characterized by distortions of size, length, position or curvature. A striking example is the Café wall illusion. Other examples are the famous Müller-Lyer illusion and Ponzo illusion.</li>
    <li>Paradox illusions (or impossible object illusions) are generated by objects that are paradoxical or impossible, such as the Penrose triangle or impossible staircase seen, for example, in M. C. Escher's Ascending and Descending and Waterfall. The triangle is an illusion dependent on a cognitive misunderstanding that adjacent edges must join.</li>
    <li>Fictions are when a figure is perceived even though it is not in the stimulus.</li>
  </ul>
